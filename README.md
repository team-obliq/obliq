Human Beings. 
We all have problems needing to be solved. 
Yet sometimes, no matter what experts surround us in our field/career, we simply don't know where to turn to solve them.

This is where Obliq steps in.

Based on & implementing Brian Eno's "Oblique Strategies" from 1975, Obliq is a full stack web application designed to bring people together
to help solve problems in real time. 

After sign up, a user is set into a "tribe" of users - paired together according to the OPPOSITE spectrum of their field/career.
This facilitates conversations organically that wouldn't normally happen to help solve individual, business or artistic concerns.

Within each communication, the entire card system of "Oblique Strategies" is able to be shared & upvoted between members - as not only a 
"gnomic" expressions, but comments on that particular problem presented. 
For every successful problem solved by either card or post, a user of the tribe then gains points, further building standing within the tribe. 
The points eventually lead to access of completely new, bigger tribes - tribes completely dissimilar to the previous one!

In this way, Obliq aims - through constraint - to redefine how people connect to solve the issues facing our world today. 

Obliq - Problem Solving: Redefined.
